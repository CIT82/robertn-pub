# My Day
## Morning
1. I will start my day at 5am and get ready for work, I work from 6am to 230pm
2. I typically don't have an appetitie in the morning but I'll try to drink some water
3. I always get anywhere from 7-9 hours of sleep but always feel tired when waking up that early
## Mid day
- I will usually grab a bite to eat at work or eat whatever it is that I bring for lunch and wrap my workday up
- If I eat something from work it will usually be a hotdog and if I bring food with me it's typically a protein shake
- If it is a gym day I'll go workout and then head home to shower
## End of day
At the end of the day I'll have dinner and spend some quality time with my wife or maybe play [xbox](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/) with my brothers.
I always set my clothes out for the next work/gym day before I go to bed.

**This is just a typical workday for me, my days off are usually a little more entertaining...haha**

*Of course I also do random things when needed such as shopping but this outline is just my basics that get done almost everyday*
